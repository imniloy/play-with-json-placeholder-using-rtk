🚀 Hey there!
I am Niloy. A Jr. Software Engineer.

I did the project with the @reduxjs/toolkit package and redux-logger in the vanilla node js project.

1 -> First in the project, I fetched one post id from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).

2 -> After fetching the post updated the response in redux state through redux toolkit.

3 -> Searched all the words inside the "title" property of the post brought in the previous step and the posts related to that post, than did another request from the JSON placeholder API and brought the data through async thunk.

4 -> In this case too, after fetching the data, I did update the response in your state through redux toolkit. Nothing rendered to the screen ui. As shown by using redux-logger to log the output to the node console. 🚀🚀

⚡⚡❤️ Thats all. Thank you dear ❤️⚡⚡
